i have sold my soul to the snake gods may they take mercy on our pure earth, dirty as it is it is eden in comparison to the slithering hell that binds our cosmos together
the government is not run by lizards but by snakes

the asteroid belt is a giant snake

jupiter is a snake egg

everything is a snake
